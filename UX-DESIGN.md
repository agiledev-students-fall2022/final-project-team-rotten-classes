# User Experience Design

## App Map
![](ux-design/AppMap.png)

The main Home Screen of the app contains navigation options to five different screens:
- Home : has a search bar, navigation bar at the bottom, displays the highest-rated classes and provides a direct way to view classes by major.
- Sort / Filter Classes
- Add Review (pop-up box to add the review / rating)
- Favorites / Bookmarked Classes : to come back and view the shortlisted classes later
- Help / Contact Us

Every course page has a rating, review and detail sections separately with a feature to get the contact details of upperclassmen who have taken the particular class previously.

This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

- [app map & wireframe instructions](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md).
- [prototype instructions](instructions-0b-prototyping.md)
