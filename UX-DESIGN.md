# User Experience Design

## App Map
![](ux-design/AppMap.png)

The main Home Screen of the app contains navigation options to five different screens:
- Home : has a search bar, navigation bar at the bottom, displays the highest-rated classes and provides a direct way to view classes by major.
- Sort / Filter Classes
- Add Review (pop-up box to add the review / rating)
- Favorites / Bookmarked Classes : to come back and view the shortlisted classes later
- Help / Contact Us

Every course page has a rating, review and detail sections separately with a feature to get the contact details of upperclassmen who have taken the particular class previously.

## Wireframe

This is the wireframe displaying all the screens (HOME screen at the center).
