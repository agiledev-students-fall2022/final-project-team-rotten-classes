The Main Home Screen of the app contains navigation options to five different screens:
- Home
- Sort / Filter Classes
- Add Review (pop-up box to add the review / rating)
- Favorites / Bookmarked Classes
- Help / Contact Us

This repository contains instructions and files for two assignments that together comprise the user experience design phase of a web app.

Replace the contents of this file with the completed assignments, as described in:

- [app map & wireframe instructions](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md).
