# Rotten Classes - Project Repository

## Product Vision Statement

Rotten Classes allows students to rate their own class experiences and view ratings of classes made by other students. Rotten Classes is an easy-to-use web-application that allows students to discover the courseload and course dynamics of a particular class for when the provided course description is not informative enough. 

At first glance, students can:
* See numeric, visual, and written reviews of a course.
* Review a course of their own.
* Search for a course or filter search options to find a course they're interested in. 

As Rotten Classes develops, students can:
* Bookmark courses that they are interested in.
* View courses that are loved by other students.
* Contact support for any problems that may arise when using the application.
