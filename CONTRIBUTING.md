# Guide to Contributing
## Team Norms

### Team Values

#### Work Values

* Team members should should communicate often through Discord to update everyone on their progress.
* Team members should respond within 48 hours when a message is directed towards them.
* Team members should finish work on time.
* Team members should notify the group when a task is put for review.
* No ideas are bad ideas! Team members should contribute ideas when discussing next steps and work collaboratively towards solutions if the team hits a creative wall.
* Team members should be kind and tolerant of everyone's work or criticism.
* Team members should NEVER judge another team member's capabilities, obstacles, etc.

#### When In Need of Help

* Team members should openly communicate problems that may impact work ability either through Discord or team meetings.
* If a team member doesn't feel comfortable specifying an obstacle, they should communicate that they are having "a problem that they don't wish to discuss" so other team members can help.
* If a task is too difficult or too large, team members should ask for help from team members, tutors, and anywhere else to accomplish said task.
* If a team member asks for help with an obstacle outside of the project, team members should help as best as they can.
* Team members who feel like they cannot finish work on time should communicate this in advance so other team members can help.

#### Conflict Resolution

* Team members should communicate peacefully and respectfully if they encounter any disagreements.
* If you discover a conflict/bug in our project, feel free to create a pull request or consult with our team members in the discord channel.
* Conflicts should be brought up to the team as soon as possible.
* If the conflict is significant, all team members should collaboratively discuss the problem and decide on the best outcome.
* If a conflict is not significant but a consensus cannot be met, team members should discuss a compromise that captures both conflicting ideas.
* If a team member is consistently failing to deliver on their obligations, other team members should communicate this and help to find solutions to any obstacles that they might be facing.

### Sprint Cadence

* A typical sprint will take 3 weeks.
* Each sprint will begin with team meetings to plan for the next sprint.
* Within the middle of the sprint, the Product Owner should re-evaluate the product backlog and make any necessary edits.
* Team members should follow the team values throughout each sprint to ensure a calm and successful sprint.

### Daily Standups

#### Daily Standup Cadence

* A typical standup meeting will last around 25 minutes.
* The location can be either Boost Library or Zoom meeting, depending on the member's time schedule.
* All members are expected to answer the following questions:
	* What have I worked on since we last met?
	* What will I work on next?
	* What obstacles am I facing that may be blocking my progress?

#### Important Information Regarding Daily Standups

* All members are expected to be present synchronously.
* Team members who cannot make it will not be able to have other team members cover for them.
* Team members who have not made progress on any tasks will be reported to management. 

### Standup Schedules

Based on the class website, the standup schedules is listed as below:

* 10/13/2022

Further time schedule will be discussed in Discord channel.

### Coding Standards

* Code Editor: Sonia Jain
* Code Linter: Alaa Al Shaba


* Code formatting should be standardized, and complied with the general instructions provided on each sprint.
	* Use descriptive and uniform variable and function names.
	* Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
	* Comment code when necessary.
	* Dead/unused code and comments should be deleted.
* Only engineer the minimum code needed for a featureâ€“Advancements to code will be iterated over.
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code. 
* Before contribution, always remember to pull from the repository before push any changes.
* A descriptive commit message is required when pushing changes.
* Commit and push code often! Once code is **working**, it should be pushed. It is preferred to write small commits instead of big changes.
* If you break the pipeline, fix it.
* Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once we cover this part).

### Concluding Thoughts

If we follow our team norms, we should be in for a successful semester and fun sprints! By the end, we can create a wonderful project that no doubt can have a great future ahead of it! We got this:)

## Git Workflow

* Follow a [centralized workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#:~:text=A%20Git%20workflow%20is%20a,in%20how%20users%20manage%20changes.).

## Contribution Information

### Basic Rules for Contributing

* Work on your own dedicated branch to avoid overriding or pushing code that may not be functional.
* Pull code OFTEN to be fully updated.
* Never remove or override other's code unless given permission.

### Adding New Features

* If you want to add a new feature and are ready to commit, feel free to create a merge request or consult with our team members in the discord channel.
* After making a request, give notice to code editors and linters on when your code is finalized.
* If you reach a conflict, it's possible the version being merged is not updated. Figure this out, with team members if necessary, before finalizing a merge.

### Sensitive Information

* DO NOT contribute sensitive information such as passwords into the repository. If you are unsure about what information is sensitive, please consult our team members.
* .gitignore file should be updated accordingly.

## Project Instructions

### Setting Up

GitHub repository will provide the latest tested version of our project. To set up a project on the computer, you need to:

1. Click here to install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2022/final-project-team-rotten-classes.git) into your VSCode project.

### Building And Testing

Further information will be updated once the project reaches this stage.
