# Guide to Contributing
## Team Norms

### Team Values

#### Work Values

* Team members should collaborate and communicate when working.
* Team members should respond within 48 hours when a message is directed towards them.
* Team members should finish work on time.
* Team members should notify the group when a task is put for review.
* No ideas are bad ideas! Team members should contribute ideas when discussing next steps and work collaboratively towards solutions if the team hits a creative wall.
* Team members should be kind and tolerant of everyone's work or criticism, 

#### When In Need of Help

* Team members should help each other if one member encounters obstacles.
* Team members who feel like they cannot finish work on time should communicate this in advance so other team members can help.

#### Conflict Resolution

* Team members should communicate peacefully and respectfully if encounter any disagreements.
* If you discover a conflict/bug in our project, feel free to create a pull request or consult with our team members in the discord channel.
* For team members, conflicts should be brought up to the team as soon as possible.
* If the conflict is significant, all team members should collaboratively discuss the problem and decide on the best outcome.
* If a conflict is not significant but a consensus cannot be met, team members should discuss a compromise that work's with conflicting ideas.
* If a team member is consistently failing to deliver on their obligations, team members should communicate this and help to find solutions to any obstacles that they might be facing.

### Sprint Cadence
* A typical sprint will take 2 weeks.
* Each sprint will begin with team meetings to plan for the next sprint.
* Within the middle of the sprint, the Product Owner should re-evaluate the product backlog and make any necessary edits.
* Team members should follow the team values throughout each sprint to ensure a calm and successful sprint.

### Daily Standups

* A typical standup meeting will last around 25 minutes.
* All members are expected to present synchronously.
* All members are expected to answer the following questions:
	* What have I worked on since we last met?
	* What will I work on next?
	* What obstacles am I facing that may be blocking my progress?
* The location can be either Boost Library or Zoom meeting, depending on the member's time schedule.

### Standup Schedules

Based on the class website, the standup schedules is listed as below:

* 10/13/2022

### Coding Standards

* Code formatting should be standardized, and complied with the general instructions provided on each sprint.
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code. 
* Before contribution, always remember to pull from the repository before push any changes.
* A descriptive commit message is highly recommended along with pushing the changes.
* It is preferred to write small commits instead of big changes.
* It is encouraged to comment/annotate on the code.
* Variable names and function names should be descriptive and uniform. 
* Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once we cover this part).

### Concluding Thoughts

If we follow our team norms, we should be in for a successful semester and fun sprints! By the end, we can create a wonderful project that no doubt can have a great future ahead of it!
